# Python Wrapper for the Weatherbit API
This module communicates with the [Weatherbit API](https://www.weatherbit.io/api) and can retrieve data for:

* Current Conditions
* Forecast Data
* Severe Weather Alerts
* Air Quility

It will require an API Key to work, which can be retrieved for free at [Weatherbit](https://www.weatherbit.io/account/create)
